Bitwise NOT reverses the original bit...
1----0
0----1

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a=false;
    cout<<~a;
}

OUTPUT
-1

REASON
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
on the negation of each bit
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
WE GOT THE NUMBER IS NEGATIVE...
on taking 1's complement
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
And 2's complement
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
SO FINALLY
NUMBER IS -1...
