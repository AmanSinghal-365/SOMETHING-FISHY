The size of the empty class is 1, not zero
It is because we have to provide class an existence...
if it has zero memory then it is not present...
we can't identify it
And minimum possible allocatable memory is 1 byte

PROGRAM::
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class animal{

};
int main()
{
    cout<<"SIZE OF EMPTY CLASS IS "<<sizeof(animal);
}

OUTPUT::
THE SIZE OF THE EMPTY CLASS IS 1
